# VIBEKIT CLI

![VibeKit CLI](/assets/screenshots/clean-sharex-beautified.png)

> A CLI that automates the [VibeKit Framework](https://github.com/MUKE-coder/vibekit) workflow for building production apps with AI agents. Plan your app with an AI agent, generate project files, then build automatically — for **web (Next.js), mobile (Expo), or full-stack (Turbo) projects**.

**Built on top of the VibeKit Framework by [JB (Muke Johnbaptist)](https://jb.desishub.com) · [Desishub Technologies](https://desishub.com)**

---

> **Alpha software.** This CLI has been tested on a small number of devices (Windows 11) and with Claude Code as the primary provider. Other providers (Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode) are wired up but largely untested. Expect rough edges, bugs, and missing polish. Contributions and bug reports are very welcome.

---

## What is this?

The [VibeKit Framework](https://github.com/MUKE-coder/vibekit) is a planning + building system for vibe coders using AI agents. The original workflow is manual:

1. Copy `CLAUDE_PROMPT.md` → paste into Claude.ai → answer questions → download planning files
2. Copy framework files into your project root
3. Open your AI provider → paste `prompt.md` → start building

**`create-vibekit-app` automates all of that** into a single command with two guided sessions:

```
npx create-vibekit-app my-app
```

**Now supporting:** Web apps (Next.js 🌐), Mobile apps (Expo 📱), or Full-Stack (Turbo Monorepo 🚀)

---

## How it works

```
npx create-vibekit-app my-app
```

**Step 1: Scaffold your project**

The CLI creates the appropriate project structure with framework configs, environment templates, and VibeKit framework files pre-populated.

**Step 2: Describe your idea**

```
◇  Describe your app idea in 1-3 sentences:
│  A school management system where teachers manage
│  students and parents can pay fees online.
```

**Step 3: Choose your platform**

```
┌  create-vibekit-app
│
◇  What would you like to build?
│  ● Web (Next.js)
│  ○ Mobile (Expo)
│  ○ Both (Turbo Monorepo)
```

Pick your platform:

- **Web** → Next.js SPA with server components, deployed to Vercel
- **Mobile** → Expo app for iOS + Android, built with EAS
- **Both** → Turbo monorepo with shared database, API routes, and auth

If you choose **Both**, select your monorepo structure:

- **Shared root API** → `apps/web` + `apps/mobile` with API routes at project root
- **Monorepo with packages** → `apps/web` + `apps/mobile` + `packages/types` + `packages/schemas`

**Step 4: Pick your AI provider**

```
◇  Which AI provider should build your project?
│  ● Claude Code
│  ○ Codex (OpenAI)   not installed
│  ○ Gemini CLI       not installed
│  ○ OpenCode         not installed
```

**Step 5: Session 1 - Planning**

Your app idea + platform choice is injected into the VibeKit planning prompt and written to `CLAUDE.md`. Your AI provider launches and interviews you about:

- Features, data model, user roles
- Integrations (auth, payments, file uploads, email)
- Visual design (brand color, typography, dark mode)

Then it generates **project planning files**:

| File                     | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project-description.md` | Complete app spec features, data model, pages, integrations     |
| `project-phases.md`      | Phase-by-phase build blueprint with checkboxes                  |
| `design-style-guide.md`  | Fully customized design system (colors, typography, components) |
| `prompt.md`              | The build prompt for Session 2                                  |

Close the provider when planning is done.

**Step 6: Session 2 - Build**

The CLI detects the generated files and offers to start the build session:

```
◇  Planning files detected
│
◇  Session 2  Build. Start [Provider] now?
│  Yes
│
●  [Provider] will read prompt.md and start Phase 1.
```

Your provider reads `prompt.md` which instructs it to:

1. Read the platform-specific `master_prompt.md` (tech stack rules, patterns, standards)
2. Read `design-style-guide.md` (your custom design system)
3. Read `jb-components.md` (component registry reference)
4. Read `project-description.md` + `project-phases.md` (the plan)
5. Start Phase 1 and stop after each phase for confirmation

After Session 1 completes, the agent also generastack rules + Prisma v7 patterns

```

After Session 1 completes, the agent also writes:

```

## Credits

This CLI is built on top of the **VibeKit Framework** created by [JB (Muke Johnbaptist)](https://jb.desishub.com) of [Desishub Technologies](https://desishub.com).

- Original framework: [github.com/MUKE-coder/vibekit](https://github.com/MUKE-coder/vibekit)
- JB Component Registry: [jb.desishub.com/blog/jb-component-registry-complete-reference](https://jb.desishub.com/blog/jb-component-registry-complete-reference)
- Framework docs site: [vibekit.desishub.com](https://vibekit.desishub.com)

The planning prompts, master prompt, tech stack decisions, design system approach, and JB component registry are all JB's original work. This repo wraps them in a CLI so you don't have to copy-paste anything manually.
