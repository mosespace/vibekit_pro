const problems = [
  {
    pain: "AI slop design",
    looks: "Every app looks the same — purple gradients, generic shadcn defaults, no brand identity.",
    solution: "design-style-guide.md is customized per project (colors, typography, spacing) and Claude Code follows it exactly.",
  },
  {
    pain: "Inconsistent UI",
    looks: "Buttons, cards, and forms look slightly different on every page.",
    solution: "Design tokens defined in one place, enforced by the master prompt across every component.",
  },
  {
    pain: "Shipping broken auth",
    looks: "AI writes insecure login flows, missing password reset, no OAuth, session bugs.",
    solution: "jb-components.md points Claude to install JB Better Auth UI — battle-tested auth in one command.",
  },
  {
    pain: "Burning tokens",
    looks: "$100–$200 per project because AI rewrites boilerplate every time (auth, tables, forms, uploads).",
    solution: "JB Component Registry covers the big primitives — AI installs and wires up instead of writing from scratch (60–80% token savings).",
  },
  {
    pain: "Getting stuck in loops",
    looks: "AI tries the same broken fix repeatedly, context gets polluted, progress stalls.",
    solution: "Phase-based build + rescue prompts in prompt-engineering.md + troubleshooting.md playbook.",
  },
  {
    pain: "No plan, no clarity",
    looks: "Starting with “build me a SaaS” and hoping for the best.",
    solution: "Claude interviews you first, generates project-description.md + project-phases.md — a clear blueprint before a single line of code.",
  },
  {
    pain: "Tech stack chaos",
    looks: "AI picks a different stack every project — jsPDF here, Drizzle there, useEffect for data.",
    solution: "Master prompt locks the stack: Next.js 16 + Prisma v7 + React Query + Zod + @react-pdf/renderer + xlsx — always.",
  },
  {
    pain: "Prisma version drift",
    looks: "AI mixes Prisma v6 and v7 patterns, breaks the build.",
    solution: "Master prompt enforces Prisma v7 patterns exactly (generator, custom output path, adapter-pg).",
  },
  {
    pain: "Deployment confusion",
    looks: "App works locally, breaks in production — env vars, DNS, SSL, email spam.",
    solution: "deployment.md + environment-variables.md walk through every step with checklists.",
  },
  {
    pain: "Vague prompts = vague code",
    looks: "“Make it look better” produces unpredictable changes that break other things.",
    solution: "prompt-engineering.md teaches the 5-part formula and context-loading technique.",
  },
  {
    pain: "Payment setup hell",
    looks: "Stripe keys, webhooks, feature gating, billing pages — most builds never ship monetization.",
    solution: "monetization-guide.md + JB Stripe UI component handle the full flow.",
  },
  {
    pain: "Losing track of progress",
    looks: "Mid-build, no idea what’s done vs. what’s left.",
    solution: "Phase tasks in project-phases.md are checkboxes — Claude Code checks them off as it goes.",
  },
  {
    pain: "No rescue plan when AI breaks",
    looks: "Build stalls for hours because AI keeps making it worse.",
    solution: "Rescue prompts + hard-reset protocol + the V0 bypass technique in prompt-engineering.md.",
  },
